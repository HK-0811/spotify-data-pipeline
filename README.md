![image](https://github.com/HK-0811/spotify-data-pipeline/blob/master/assets/SpotifyDataPipeline.png)
This project demonstrates the creation of an automated data pipeline using Spotify API, AWS services, and Apache Airflow. It fetches real-time data on songs, albums, and artists, processes it using AWS Glue, and stores it in an optimized format in AWS S3. A Lambda function ensures event-driven automation by triggering the Glue ETL job upon data insertion into S3. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow for seamless workflows, and the processed data is analyzed and visualized in Power BI. This project showcases ETL processes, cloud services, and data visualization expertise.
